# Improving your C# Skills
This course shows you how to create high performing applications and solve programming challenges using the wide range of C# features. You’ll begin by learning how to identify the bottlenecks in writing programs, highlight common performance pitfalls, and apply strategies to detect and resolve these issues early. You'll also study the importance of microservices architecture for building fast applications and implementing resiliency and security in .NET Core. Then, you'll study the importance of defining and testing boundaries, abstracting away third-party code, and working with different types of test double, such as spies, mocks, and fakes. In addition to describing programming trade-offs, this course will also help you build a useful toolkit of techniques, including value caching, statistical analysis, and geometric algorithms. 

By the end of this course, you'll be a TDD expert, who can also structure and build scalable, optimized, and robust applications in C#7 and .NET.


## What you will learn
* Measure application performance using BenchmarkDotNet
* Leverage TPL and PLINQ libraries to perform asynchronous operations
* Modify a legacy application to make it testable
* Use LINQ and PLINQ to search directories for files matching patterns
* Find areas of polygons using geometric operations
* Randomize arrays and lists with extension methods
* Use cryptographic techniques to encrypt and decrypt strings and files


### Hardware requirements
For an optimal student experience, we recommend the following hardware configuration:
* 1.8 GHz or faster processor. Dualcore or better recommended 2 GB of RAM; 4 GB of RAM recommended (2.5 GB minimum if running on a
virtual machine)
* Hard disk space: up to 130 GB of available space, depending on features installed; typical installations require 20-50 GB
of free space.
* Hard disk speed: to improve performance, install Windows and Visual Studio on a solid state drive (SSD).
* Video card that supports a minimum display resolution of 720p (1280 by 720);
* Visual Studio will work best at a resolution of WXGA (1366 by 768) or higher



### Software requirements
You’ll also need the following software installed in advance:
* Visual Studio 2017 or Visual Studio Code
